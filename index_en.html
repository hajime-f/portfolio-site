            <ul>
              <li>After completing my Ph.D. with a specialization in Machine Learning, I joined an automotive company where I engaged in R&D for specialized in-vehicle systems applying data science. I contributed to the development and practical application of numerous foundational technologies that formed the core of these systems.</li>
              <li>Subsequently, I served as an R&D Manager at an AI-focused company. In parallel with managing the department, I was responsible for technology strategy planning, leading tech public relations initiatives, and strengthening the intellectual property framework. I successfully managed non-routine projects and resolved numerous business challenges.</li>
              <li>Most recently, at a reuse technology company, I established and managed the R&D team as a Research Director. I handled a wide range of strategic R&D tasks, including defining research themes, enhancing team structure, and planning collaborative research projects with universities.</li>

          <h2>Personality</h2>
	  <h3>Character</h3>
          <p>I am a results-oriented individual who finds great satisfaction in achieving goals through my own initiative and effort. I possess a strong conviction in my own judgment and will not accept a direction unless I am thoroughly convinced of its merits. Conversely, once I commit to a decision, I have the determination to see it through to completion.</p>
          <p>When a goal is clearly defined and I understand its significance, I am driven to achieve it by any effective means. In my earlier years, this drive sometimes led me to push forward without fully considering the perspectives of others, which occasionally caused friction. With experience, I have learned to temper this determination with greater diplomacy and consideration.</p>
          <p>For reference, my 16 Personalities type is <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/ja/entj%E5%9E%8B%E3%81%AE%E6%80%A7%E6%A0%BC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"The Commander" (ENTJ)</a>.</p>

	  <h3>Aptitude</h3>
          <p>This character has cultivated my natural aptitude for <b>"leading the room."</b> While this is a versatile skill, I am particularly adept in the following three areas where its conditions are clearly met:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Facilitation</li>
            <li>Presentation</li>
            <li>Client Negotiation</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The essence of my aptitude lies in <b>"driving communication."</b> It becomes especially effective when combined with the application of specialized knowledge.</p>
          <p>Reflecting on my career, I have consistently delivered my best performance and achieved significant results under the following conditions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>When a visionary leader provides a clear challenge and direction that I find compelling.</b></li>
            <li><b>When I can tackle problem-solving in line with that direction, in a way that fully leverages my natural aptitudes.</b></li>
          </ul>
